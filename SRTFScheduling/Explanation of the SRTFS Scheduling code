The `Processs` class represents a task with an ID, arrival time, burst time (total execution time), and remaining time.

In the main method:
   - 79 processes are created with random arrival times (0-10) and burst times (1-10).

The `srtfScheduling` method does the scheduling:
   a. Sort processes by arrival time.
   b. Initialize variables to keep track of time, completed processes, etc.
   c. Main scheduling loop:
      - Find the process with the shortest remaining time that has arrived.
      - If no process is available, increase time and continue.
      - Reduce the remaining time of the selected process by 1.
      - If a process completes:
        * Mark it as complete.
        * Calculate its waiting time and turnaround time.
      - Increase current time by 1.
   d. After all processes complete, calculate average waiting and turnaround times.

The algorithm prioritizes processes with the shortest remaining time at each step, potentially interrupting running processes if a shorter one arrives.

Finally, it prints details for each process and the average waiting and turnaround times.

This SRTF algorithm aims to minimize average waiting time by always working on the process that will finish soonest.
