Setup:
We have 79 processes.
Each process has a name (P1, P2, etc.) and a burst time (1-10).
The time quantum (the maximum time a process can run at once) is 2.


Main Algorithm:
The algorithm runs in rounds.
In each round, it goes through all processes:
If a process still has time left to run:
  If it needs more than 2 time units, it runs for 2 units and then pauses.
  If it needs 2 or fewer time units, it completes.

This continues until all processes are finished

Time Calculation:
Waiting time for a process = Time it finishes - Its total burst time
Turnaround time = Waiting time + Burst time

Output:
The code prints details for each process:
Process name
Burst time
Waiting time
Turnaround time

It then calculates and prints the average waiting time and turnaround time.

The Round Robin algorithm aims to be fair by giving each process a short turn to run, then moving to the next one.
