Setup:
We have 79 processes (P1, P2, ..., P79).
Each process has a burst time (execution time) between 1 and 10.

Main Algorithm:
Processes are executed in the order they arrive (P1 first, then P2, and so on).
No process is interrupted once it starts executing.

Time Calculations:
  Waiting time for each process:
    For the first process (P1): 0
    For others: Sum of burst times of all previous processes
  Turnaround time for each process:
    Waiting time + Its own burst time

Output:
  For each process, it prints:
    Process name
    Burst time
    Waiting time
    Turnaround time

Average Times:
  Calculates and prints:
    Average waiting time
    Average turnaround time

The FCFS algorithm is simple: it processes tasks in the exact order they arrive.
