The NoOfProcess class:
Represents a process with a name, burst time (execution time), and priority.

Main method:
Creates 79 processes (P1 to P79).
Each process has:
Random burst time between 1 and 10
Random priority between 1 and 10

The priorityScheduling method:
Sorts processes by priority (lower number = higher priority).
Processes them in order of priority.

For each process:
Calculates waiting time (time spent waiting before execution starts).
Calculates turnaround time (total time from arrival to completion).
Updates the current time.
Prints process details.

After processing all processes:
Calculates and prints average waiting time.
Calculates and prints average turnaround time.

The algorithm assumes:
All processes arrive at the same time.
Lower priority number means higher priority.
Once a process starts, it runs to completion (non-preemptive).

This Priority Scheduling aims to execute higher priority processes first, potentially at the cost of longer waiting times for lower priority processes.
